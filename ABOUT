DiscloseNet is a software for hosting a website to serve as a public
institute repository of academic research publications of the

The website is designed so that _all_ visitors may view its content, 
which consists of research publications. The software allows content to 
be searched easily by centre (subject-area / department), content-type 
(book, thesis, etc.), author and date range. It allows teams to add and 
moderate the content. For more details see the README.txt file.

DiscloseNet is released under the GPLv3 open source license. For more
